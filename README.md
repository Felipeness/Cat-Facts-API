# Cat-Facts-API
API that consumes facts about cats, made in Professor Jonathan's class

# 🐱 Cat Facts Project 🐱

Welcome to the Cat Facts Project! This application fetches intriguing cat facts using the [Cat Fact API](https://catfact.ninja/fact). Not only will you learn fascinating tidbits about our feline friends, but you'll also get a taste of how modern web technologies work!

## 🌐 Understanding APIs 🌐

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software entities to communicate with each other. In the context of web development, APIs often refer to web services that return data. This project uses the Cat Fact API to retrieve random cat facts.

## ⚙️ The Power of `async` and `await` ⚙️

JavaScript's `async` and `await` are modern features that make working with asynchronous operations, like calling APIs, more readable and manageable. Here's a simple breakdown:

- `async`: This keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, which returns a promise.
- `await`: This keyword is used inside an `async` function to wait for a promise to be resolved.

In our project, we use `async` and `await` to seamlessly fetch cat facts without blocking the rest of the application.

## 🎨 Styling with CSS 🎨

While functionality is crucial, presentation cannot be ignored! Our application is styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is a stylesheet language that describes the look and formatting of a document, allowing us to add colors, layouts, and fonts to make our application visually appealing.

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

1. **Fetching Cat Facts**:
   Inside our main function, we'll be making an API call to `https://catfact.ninja/fact` to retrieve a random cat fact.

2. **Understanding the Code**:
   Dive into the codebase to see how `async` and `await` are utilized for fetching data and how CSS brings our application to life.

3. **Have Fun & Learn**:
   Explore the application, tweak the styles, or add new features. The world of web development awaits!
